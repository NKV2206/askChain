This folder contains all *Agents* used in the application that can be found in their aptly named python files. `agent_utils.py` exposes several useful data structures and constructs related to agents including a generic run function that allows you to receive response from that Agent. You will need to have a `.env` file in the root directory containing your `GROQ_API_KEY`. All modules listed in `requirements.txt` should be installed in your virtual environment.
