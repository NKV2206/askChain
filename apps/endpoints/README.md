This folder contains all *agent endpoints* used in the application that can be found in their aptly named python files. All modules listed in `requirements.txt` should be installed in your virtual environment. There are 2 kinds of endpoints: `/{subject}/ask` and `/finetune`. The latter has no implementation other than a dummy success return whereas the former supports `math/ask`, `compsci/ask`, `physics/ask`. If running a file as `__main__`, please run it from the root directory of the application and go to the designated port which can be configured in the file if needed.
